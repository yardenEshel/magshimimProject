# magshimimProject
My friend and I developed this project as our capstone for "Magshimim," an excellence program that high school students can join.

The project sets up a server within a LAN to provide computational resources and storage to other computers. Users can specify their needs and run demanding applications through the server, which also offers shared storage with access control. A web server interface facilitates user interaction.

**Introduction**
This document provides a comprehensive guide to our project, aimed at enhancing resource utilization within an organizational network by leveraging a centralized server. The project allows networked computers to dynamically access additional processing power and storage.

**Project Overview**
Objective
Enable computers within a LAN to utilize unused computational resources from other networked computers, enhancing the capabilities of machines with lower processing power without hardware upgrades.

**Key Features**

**Resource Sharing**: Dynamic access to additional processing power and storage from a central server.

**Application Offloading**: Run heavy applications on resource-abundant machines, while less capable machines manage the display.

**Shared Storage**: Centralized storage with a robust access control system to ensure data privacy.

**User-Friendly Interface**: A web server facilitates all user interactions with the system, providing a smooth and intuitive experience.
Technical Specifications
Components
**Server**: Manages resource allocation, application operations, and user authentication.

**Client Software**: Installed on each userâ€™s machine, allowing resource requests and application management.

**Web Interface**: Hosts the graphical user interface for user management and interaction.

**Database**: Stores user data and permissions, supports secure access control and resource tracking.

System Architecture
**Resource Allocation**: Automatically allocates processing power and storage based on availability and demand.

**Security Protocols**: Ensures secure data handling and communication within the network through encryption and access controls.

Setup and Installation
Requirements
**Server**: Capable of handling multiple simultaneous connections and requests.

**Client Machines:** Must be connected to the LAN and equipped with client software.

**Web Server**: To host the user interface for managing interactions.

****Usage
Users can manage their resource needs and access shared storage through a dedicated web interface, which simplifies the interaction with the system's robust capabilities.

**Conclusion**
The project uses advanced networking and resource management techniques to significantly enhance computational capabilities across organizational computers, promoting efficient resource utilization and optimal performance within the LAN.
